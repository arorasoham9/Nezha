# ECE 49595OSS Project
A Zero Trust Network Access, “never trust, always verify”, proxy  that offers limited application and server access to only users who have been explicitly approved. The client application is not exposed to the internet and does not exist on the global subnet. Only when a user is authenticated with Google and authorized with the proxy, a pipeline is opened to the application to offer user-specific, restricted access to the application.

- UI: Frontend v0.1
